* Readings
** Dunway - Sudden Violence
"The story of the Exxon Valdez --- and its emotion-saturated media coverage --- provides
an iconic esample of what the philosopher Slavoj Zizek terms 'subjective violence':
sudden, immediate bursts of violence typically 'performed by a clearly identifiable agent'".


"Yet this focus on the shocking violence in Prince William Sound also represented a failure
to grapple with what Zizek refers to as 'systematic violence': 'the often catastrophic
consequences of the smooth functioning of our economic and political systems'".
** Griffin
"During the heady days of feminism, there were some who turned this idea on its head
and argued that indeed women are closer to nature, a proximity making us superior
to men."

** Sharon Black, Thomas Wright, Lynnette Erickson
"The Surprising Things Maui Did, a simplified retelling of the Hawaiian versions of some of the
most famous Maui tales, by Jay Williams (1979), illustrated by Charles Mikolaycak, begins, 'Long
ago... people who lived on the islands of Hawaii and Oahu and Molokai... were poor and hungry,
cold and sad. Then, there came a boy named Maui who changed everything.'"

"The function of folktales and mythology to explain why the world is like it is becomes easily
apparent, as Maui's 'amazing things' change the structure of nature and the routine of people's
lives: providing space, increasing daylight, and otherwise improving nature to ease the living
conditions of his people."
