\textit{Moana} is an animated film created by Disney in 2016, and directed by Ron Clements and
John Musker (IMDb) In the movie, a young girl named Moana from a Pacific Island tribe must journey across
the ocean to help the demigod Maui restore the heart of the goddess Te Fiti that he stole long
ago to save her island and people from impending doom and death. As an infant she is chosen by
the sea for this task, but it isn't until she is older that she defies the wishes of her father,
sneaks out in a boat, and sails off to find Maui and make him restore the heart.

\textit{Moana} is an animated film released by Disney in 2016, and directed by Ron Clements and
John Musker. The movie begins with a tale of how long ago the demigod Maui stole the heart of
the goddess Te Fiti as a gift to mankind. But this theft was a mistake, as it angered Te Fiti and
awoke many other foul monsters who sought out the heart. The world then became a dangerous place,
and life was slowly being drained from island and island throughout the sea. On one of these
islands, a young girl named Moana, after helping a baby turtle escape to the ocean, is chosen
by the ocean to journey across it to find Maui, and help him restore the heart and save her
people. One night after some help from her Mother and Grandmother, Moana goes against the
wishes of her father and sets sail. She soon finds Maui and helps him get back his hook from
Tamatoa, the giant crab who stole it. With hook in hand Maui and Moana head for Te Fiti to
restore the heart. A giant monster who guards the island attacks them and almost defeats
the duo, but Moana manages to make it to the island. But when Moana arrives, she realizes that
the angry monster guarding the island of Te Fiti is actually Te Fiti herself angry at the loss
of her heart. Moana graciously gives the heart back to Te Fiti, restoring her to former glory.
The day is saved, and Moana returns to her home a hero and her people become seafaring once
again.

Moana is clearly the protagonist of the film, and is established as such quite early in the
film. The infant Moana is shown playing around by the ocean, looking for shells on the beach.
But, she is distracted by the noises of some birds shown in the background of the shot off by
the edge of the jungle. The calls of the birds seem to break the monotonous crashing of the
waves in a jarring manor. This is followed by an over the shoulder shot of the birds now in
focus, as the young Moana gazes in their direction. This quickly cuts to a close up shot of
a baby turtle hiding beneath a log, clearly at the center of attention of the birds. The
turtle is looking towards the sky timidly with a look on its face easily described as puppy
dog eyes. The next shot shows just a grove of bushes, when a hand juts up through the bottom
of the frame. The shot is cropped well above the head of Moana, showcasing just how short and
young she is. The hand barely grasps one of the large fronds and and pulls it out. The scene
cuts to a shot of the camera looking directly downward at the beach sand at a set of 2 prints:
the human footprints of Moana and the flipper prints of the baby turtle. The camera pans upward,
following the pair of prints to almost the edge of the ocean where Moana is seen holding the
large green leaf over the turtle, protecting it from the preying birds. Some time has elapsed
before this cut, as they are moving slowly but are first shown with quite a lot of progress.
A very low angle shot closer to the action follows, with a black angry looking bird approaching
Moana and the sheltered turtle. It snaps at the turtle, and Moana kicks at the bird shouting
``Shoo! Shoo!'', while another bird sneaks up from behind and snaps at the turtle. The second
bird almost succeeds before Moana chases it away, but not before the turtle is flipped onto
its back. The low angle of the camera makes Moana seem all powerful and in control, even
though she cannot be more than a few years old. Another close up shot of the turtle shows the
seemingly towering baby Moana flip the turtle onto its front, where it then swims away into
the ocean.

Just as the viewer is expecting the scene to end, a wide angle shot from out on the ocean
looking towards Moana on the beach appears, and shows a magic wave rushing towards the shore
with a sparkling sound almost like thousands of tiny bells ringing and a light whistling
in the air. A high angle shot shows the wave hitting the shore, reminding the viewer how
small Moana is from the aerial view. The ocean suddenly parts in front of Moana, exposing
a conch shell she was chasing after earlier. As she reaches down to pick up the shell, a
musical number starts with gentle singing. The sea continues to split revealing shells,
as Moana follows the trail of shell breadcrumbs. Through the split in the sea a large
turtle is seen, possibly the parent of the turtle just saved from the birds. The music
swells as it swims by. After the turtle leaves, a faceless but clearly intelligent wave
rises from the surface, and playfully messes with Moana's hair. This cuts to a view out into
the ocean, as a green stone known to be the heart of Te Fiti rushes towards the rift in the
ocean. A magical sounding ringing accompanies its movements. As it gets close, Moana reaches
into the wall of water grabbing the stone. A close up of Moana gently feeling the patterns
of the rock confirms any suspicions of what the rock is. The scene ends with Moana's Father
calling out to her from the shore, and the giant sentient wave pushing her back to the beach.

This scene establishes many things vital to the movie. First it pushes the idea that Moana
even from a young age is a lover of nature and the environment. She protected the turtle from
the evil looking birds saving its life, and allowing it to be with its family. Moana is a
hero because of it. According to Susan Griffin, an author famous for her ideas on ecofeminism
``During the heady days of feminism, there were some who\ldots argued that indeed women are
closer to nature [than men], a proximity making us superior to men.'' Moana seems to follow
this line of thought, as her closeness to nature gives her a superiority over the others on
her island --- being chosen by the sea to have the heart of Te Fiti.

Although the ``good guy'' in Moana is blatantly obvious to any viewer of the film, the antagonist
is a bit more difficult to decipher. There are a long list of characters who could qualify for
the position: the enraged fiery Te Fiti guarding the island, the greedy crab Tamatoa who stole
Maui's magical fish hook, or maybe Moana's father the chief for not letting Moana leave the
island. But the most sensible person to be the antagonist of the movie would be who created the
mess that everyone seems to be in --- Maui himself. It was him who originally stole the heart
causing the death of the islands, the loss of food for Moana's people, the enraging of Te Fiti,
the loss of the fish hook, and the countless dangers that roam the sea. Maui is the reason Moana
has to adventure from home, and put her life in danger for her people.

Despite this however, it
is a gross oversimplification to call Maui the antagonist for the entire duration of the movie, and
even to call him evil for stealing the heart in the first place. He stole the heart to appease
humans in the first place as a hero of the people, and aided Moana in returning it for the same
reasons. Maui also starts out as a rather selfish character when he is introduced to Moana. He
brags to Moana about all he has done for humans before stealing her boat and locking her in a
cave. But as the movie progresses and he warms up to Moana, he becomes a much less selfish
demigod, and even risks his life and magical hook to help Moana restore the heart of Te Fiti.
Perhaps it is more accurate then to call Maui of thousands of years ago the antagonist of
\textit{Moana}, while the Maui present in most of the movie is at least a helpful companion if
not a protagonist himself. 

In an environmental context, Maui's complex character makes much more sense as a symbol in the
film. Maui in \textit{Moana} is not just representation of a single person or group, but as
humanity as a whole. When Moana first meets Maui on his island, Maui launches into a song
about all of his accomplishments for mankind. Some of these accomplishments include pulling
islands up from the ocean, lassoing the sun, creating coconut trees, and stealing fire to name
a few. These events described by Maui in the movie are quite accurate in terms of the mythology
surrounding him in Polynesian culture. As described by Sharon Black in a publication about
Polynesian Folklore: ``The function of folktales and mythology to explain why the world is
like it is becomes easily apparent, as Maui's `amazing things' change the structure of nature
and the routine of people's lives: providing space, increasing daylight, and otherwise improving
nature to ease the living conditions of his people. (Black et al)''. These things --- improving
nature, eased living conditions, increasing daylight all have real world correlations not just
to mythical and natural phenomenon, but technical advancements as well. Skyscrapers, electricity
and the light bulb, and air conditioning to name a few accomplish the same things that Maui is
renowned for.

The stealing of the heart of Te Fiti also fits into this view of Maui, as it is directly related
to greed of environmental resources. Consuming non-renewable resources is seen by many in our world
to be a heroic act, as it can improve the lives of those who consume it; just as Maui stealing
the heart can be seen as a heroic act for the people of the Pacific. This greed however has
consequences both in the movie and in the real world. In the movie the consequences are shown as
fast subjective violence: ``sudden, immediate bursts of violence typically `performed by a clearly
identifiable agent' (Dunaway)'' such as the anger of Te Fiti, the quick degradation of the island's
food supply, and the black draining of Moana's island that resembles closely an oil spill, similar
to the one Dunaway used fast violence to explain. But in real life, they manifest quite differently
in the form of climate change, deforestation, severe droughts, and more extreme weather patterns.
In the real world the consumption of these natural resources are shown as a systematic violence:
``the often catastrophic consequences of the smooth functioning of our economic and political
systems (Dunaway)''. Despite these differences, the similarities are striking. Maui and humans
have both done many great things for the advancement of humans as a species, but due to excessive
greed and overreaching of boundaries much more harm is being caused than good.

Through this same lens, the implication of Moana's character also becomes clear.  Moana's character
creates a template for how the viewer in today's society can do their part to solve climate change
and other modern environmental issues. Moana is created as an environmentally conscious individual
who goes against the mainstream of her society to aid Maui (mankind) in restoring the world back
to how it was before he was consumed by greed.

But along with pushing people to become this force of good, \textit{Moana} also tells of many of
the difficulties that go along with someone embarking on such a journey. The most prominent of
these is after attempting to make it to Te Fiti the first time, when Moana is abandoned by Maui.
Moana and Maui have a large argument about returning to the island of Te Fiti, which ends in Maui
flying away as an eagle. With a close shot of her face, Moana asks of the ocean: ``Why did you
bring me here?''. The shot cuts to a wide angle shot encompassing the entire boat, Moana, and
a very human like wave of the ocean, reaching high above Moana and seeming to look down upon her.
The wave also has a bright blue glow, in an otherwise very low key lighting from the nighttime.
The blue glow, although likely from the moon, betrays the intelligence of the ocean spirit. Moana's
seemingly insignificant size highlights her vulnerability in this moment, as she feels lost and
defeated. The scene soon ends up at a high angle from over the ``shoulder'' of the wave, with
Moana offering up the heart to the ocean. She speaks shakily ``I'm not the right person. You have
to choose someone else.'' The high angle again shows her vulnerability, and communicates how small
Moana must be feeling at this moment --- lost at sea, at night, and having failed her first
attempt to return the heart. The wave reaches down towards her hand with the glowing green rock,
sucks it up, and returns back to the surface of the water, as the heart sinks to the bottom.
Moana slumps to her knees in obvious despair. As she is staring back into the ocean, a bright blue
light appears in the distance, and quickly approaches. The camera jumps to an overhead view of the
boat, as the blue light is revealed as a manta ray that swims around the boat. The camera slowly
zooms in and pans down to show the wonder on Moana's face as she realizes her Grandma has come
to her aid. An over the shoulder shot from behind Moana in the opposite direction reveals her
Grandma as a ghost like apparition is sitting on the other end of the boat. She runs to hug her,
and as slow sad music plays gently in the background the spirit of her Grandma comforts Moana.

After both standing up, in usual Disney fashion, song again breaks out. It begins quiet as the
elder asks Moana who she really is and what she believes in. Just as the instrumentation begins
to rise, Moana takes over the singing, changing into a higher key. On the horizon, more ghost-like
boats appear on the horizon towering above Moana's small boat. The light from the apparition
fleet brightens the mood of the scene considerably, and makes both the viewer and Moana seem much
less lonely and afraid of the future. At the climax of the song she looks up confidently into
the night sky, sings loudly ``I am Moana!'', and dives into the ocean to find the heart of Te
Fiti. Near the bottom of the sea, a wide angle shot shows Moana swimming into the bright green
glow let off by the stone, followed by a close up of her grabbing the stone out of the sand.
She quickly surfaces, shoving the stone into the air triumphantly before realizing her Grandma
and the fleet of boats is no longer there. This leaves the viewer in disbelief if those things
actually happened, or were just in her head.

In the larger context of Moana being a template for environmental change, this scene serves to
show that often times when trying to change the world, doubt and a lack of confidence will likely
appear, and that the faith of others will sometimes not be with you. But as Moana does go on to
restore the heart, it shows that these setbacks are only temporary and will come to pass.
\textit{Moana} provides a template for how to save the world they live in, and follow in Moana's
footsteps. And even though saving the world is by no means easy, it is possible with help from
the right people and lots of courage.
