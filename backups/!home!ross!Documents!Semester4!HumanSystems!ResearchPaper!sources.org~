** National Security and the Accelerating Risk of Climate Change
*** Content
"Since 2006, retired U.S. admirals and generals have been examining our changing physical world and assessing the impact of those changes on the security of the nation. A Military Advisory Board (MAB, convened by the CNA Corporation, a non-profit research and analysis institution that operates the Center for Naval Analyses and Institute for Public Research) has issued two reports on the changing climate’s national security implications. The first report, published in 2007, stated that the changing climate would be destabilizing in many parts of the world. Climate change, in fact, would be a “threat multiplier”, the report claimed, and result in new and more urgent calls for the American military to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) as well as help sustain order and ensure conditions that would permit trade and prosperity worldwide. The MAB recommended urgent action by the Defense Department to prepare for new missions in new places; and that the Defense Department explicitly recognize missions stemming from the changing climate. CNA’s MAB then published three reports on energy, relating to climate change, one each on: the coming age of renewables, the nation’s energy dependence, and the future of energy in terms of America’s international competitiveness (CNA-MAB, 2009; CNA-MAB, 2010; CNA-MAB, 2011). In 2014, the Military Advisory Board noted that the climate was changing more quickly than had been forecast in 2007. Undertaking a new climate study, the board concluded that more needed to be done, and done quickly, to prepare for and confront the “catalyst for conflict” that the board now saw in climate change."

"Men and women in our armed forces are on the front lines, contending not only with direct military threats and confrontations but also with the consequences of crop failures, pollution, disease spread, mass human migrations, failed or failing states, and natural disasters, in many cases related to the heating of the planet."

"We have become convinced that climate change and American energy independence issues are serious national security issues"

"Whether the effects of climate change are felt in extreme droughts or floods, sea level rise, increasingly violent storms, the results will often include turmoil. In the face of this turmoil, America's military will often be, as it often has been, called upon to render aid or establish or maintain stability."

"Climate change and agriculture conflict contributed to massive displacement of Somalis. I have visited Somali refugee camps in northern Kenya and seen the desperation and the fertile recruiting ground these are for terrorist organizations. When young people, primarily men, have no future, no prospects, no hope, and are offered an alternative to living in the refugee camps and looking at that kind of bleak future, terrorist alternatives are seductive"

"We are now able to point to Syria, for example, where arguably many of the problems that have led to this terrible conflict and enormous loss of life began with a five-year drought of historic proportions... While these factors alone did not cause the tensions that are being played out in the conflict in Syria, they surely contributed."

"Among America's domestic implications of climate change are those I mentioned earlier: more stress on the military, more obligations and missions, and more difficulty in conducting training excercises in the United States itself. Many training days are lost now to wildfires and to flooded ranges throughout the United States.

** Climate Change and National Security: An Agenda for Action
*** Content
"Domestically, the effects of climate change could overwhelm disaster-response capabilities. Internationally, climate change may cause humanitarian disasters, contribute to political violence, and undermine weak governments."

"National security extends well beyond protecting the homeland against armed attack by other states, and indeed, beyond threats from people who purposefully seek to damage or destroy states. Phenomena like pandemic disease, natural disasters, and climate change, despite lacking human intentionality, can threaten national security."

"Like armed attacks, some of the effects of climate change could swiftly kill or endanger large numbers of people and cause such large-scale disruption that local public health, law enforcement, and emergency response units would not be able to contain the threat."

"Coastal populations in North America will be increasingly vulnerable to climate change --- and nearly 50 percent of Americans live within fifty miles of the coast."

"A NASA simulation that combined a modest forty-centimeter sea-level rise by 2050 with storm surges from a Category Three hurricane found that, without new adaptive measures, large parts of New York City would be inundated, including much of southern Brooklyn and Queens and portions of lower Manhattan."

"Climate change could, through extreme weather events, have a more direct impact on national security by severely damaging critical military bases, thereby diverting or severely undermining significant national defense resources... In 1992, Hurricane Andrew did such damage to Homestead Air Force Base in Miami that it never reopened. In 2004, damage from Hurricane Ivan kept Pensacola Naval Air Station closed for almost a year."

"Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population --- about 88 percent of its 245.5 million people. Some have been radicalized, but most have not... Climate change, through drought conditions or storms, might further destabilize Indonesia, and if the government provided a weak response to a future weather disaster, this could encourage separatists or radicals to challenge the state or launch attacks on Western interests."

** Environmental Changes and Violent Conflict
*** Content
"Overall, the existing evidence suggests that environmental changes may, under specific circumstances, increase the risk of violent conflict --- but do not systematically do so."

"Natural disasters significantly increase the risk of civil conflict, especially in countries with a lower gross domestic product, sluggish economic growth, mixed political regimes and preexisting conflicts."

** Defining National Security: the Nonmilitary Aspects
*** Content
"Narrow the range of policy choices available to a government"

"If there exists a serious threat to the well being of most Americans, these are threats to the well being of most Americans, these are threats to our nation's national security by anyone's definition."

"To say that the only valid national security threats are military ones is to give national security a definition it has not had for at least twho decades and perhaps not for two hundred years"

"A threat to national security is whatever threatens to significantly (1) degrade the quality of life of the people, or (2) narrow the range of policy choices available to their government."

"The objective of national security is to sustain freedom from foreign dictation and improvement of living standards in an environmentally sustainable fashion."

*** Contents
"Sea level will rise up to 6.6 ft., or 2 m, by the year 2100 with `business as usual' carbon emissions, according to the Climate Institute... Add to that the increased frequency of extreme weather events, food scarcity and water insecurity, all of which creates a destabilizing effect in regions and nations where governments --- already under stress --- have limited capacity to cope with these threats."

"The defense community knows that climate change has a significant and intensifying impact on national security and that this results in disruptions that exacerbate security challenges around the world."

"The U.S. Secretary of Defense addressed the significance of climate change as a driver of global instability."

** Wars, Murders to Rise Due to Global Warming
*** Contents
"Wars, murders, and other acts of violence will likely become more commonplace in coming decades as the effects of global warming cause tempers to flare worldwide, a comprehensive new study warns."

"[Researchers found] even relatively minor departures from normal temperatures or rainfall amounts substantially increased the risk of conflic on a variety of levels, ranging from individual aggression, such as murder and rape, to country-level political instability and international wars... Across the data, the researchers found similar patterns of human aggression fueled by climate factors."
