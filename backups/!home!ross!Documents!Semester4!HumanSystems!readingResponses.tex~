\label{sec:orgd13a66d}
\subsection{The 99 Best Things that Happened in 2017 - Angus Hervey}
\label{sec:orgbbef7d3}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orgfb202cb}
"In the United States, abortion rates have reached their lowest level
since 1973"

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orga8272ca}
This to me doesn't clearly indicate an increase in global health, but
more a change in the political climate in the U.S. Because abortions
are a highly controversial topic in the U.S., the abortion numbers
are not just impacted by increases in birth control or general health,
but can be impacted by the republican controlled government currently
in office.

\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orgf313680}
"Eleven countries continued their plan to build a wall of trees from east
to west across Africa in order to push back the desert"

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orgbf3c709}
I had no idea that planting trees was all it could take to reclain land from
desert. If I had to guess, it was based much more upon the climate of the area
than the vegetation present. I know that deserts around the world have been
expanding and getting hotter, but didn't know the solution could be this easy.
\subsection{Significant Impact on U.S. Interests}
\label{sec:orgffeebdf}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org2c47fda}
"In December 2017, President Donald J. Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital
of Israel and announced his intention to construct a U.S. embassy there, reversing
longstanding U.S. policy."

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org0a291e3}
What was the U.S. position on the issue before this? From my understanding the U.S.
has always been close allies of Israel, and would support Israel in whatever they
claim their capital is - which according to the article is Jerusalem. I am not sure
however on U.S. standings with Palestine, and probably explains the 

\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orgac4c244}
"There is concern that a third intifada could break out if the cease-fire does not
hold and the renewed October 2015 tensions escalate into large scale violence."

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org63172f7}
I personally don't seeing this being resolved anytime within the near future.
Both sides here seem so intrenched in the ideas about Jerusalem and the geography
of the region, that they won't give up their views or be satisfied regardless
of what the U.S. is trying to do in the region.
\subsection{Critical Impact on U.S. Interests}
\label{sec:org9524cfd}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orga9ddbe2}
"North Korea's government has continued its aggressive and erratic behavior, as
demonstrated by recent military and cyber probocations\ldots{}"

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orgcc40c67}
The part I find more surprising about North Korea's aggressions is the cyber aspect.
Nuclear weapons have existed and have been capable of use since the second world war,
and as Korea is a ways behind lots of the world in many ways them aquiring nukes is
not a huge surprise - it was going to happen eventually. Cyber attacks however require
a much more modern understanding of the world, along with a strongly educated population.
The ability of an almost 3rd world country to commit cyber attacks is incredible.
\section{Week 2: The World Today}
\label{sec:org81f7c47}
\subsection{10 Conflicts to Watch in 2018 - Robert Malley}
\label{sec:org9c05e75}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org4d6a762}
"It's not all about Donald Trump. That's a statement more easily written than believed"

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org0b88130}
This statement really hit home, that its a shock that not all top U.S. conflicts are
caused by our presidents actions. He has been involved in so much conflict over the past
year, that to have something not caused by him is surprising.

\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orgf653140}
"Trump wasn't shaping the public mood. He was reflecting it."

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orgfc28d47}
I often wonder how the world would be different if a different president was elected.
Many things have changed over the past year, but the question arises - where does it
come from? Does it come from the election of the president itself, or from the people
who share his views and elected him? Would the rising issues of white suppremesism,
race problems, nationalism, and other problems become as prominent as they are if a
different leader was elected? I believe they would have, because its the citizens
that drive a country, not the government in the end.

\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org260088c}
"The conflict in eastern Ukraine has claimed over 10,000 lives and constitutes a grave
ongoing humanitarian crisis. While it persists, relations between Russia and the West
are unlikely to improve."

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orgf132d75}
I am surprised that Ukraine is still seen as a conflict to watch in 2018, as I thought
the majority of the conflict was resolved in early 2017. Although I know Putin wants
Ukraine back in Russia's control, he knows that to take it by force would be very bad
for his public image in the world, another thing he does not need on his plate.
\subsection{Wars of the World - Perry Cammack}
\label{sec:org68cae2d}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org5776773}
"One study found that the average duration of civil wars increased from five
years in 1950 to fifteen years by 2000."

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org869762b}
This is very disconcerting to me. I like to think that ever since the cold war
the world has become a less violent place, and in some respects it has. But in
others, like issues of civil wars, this shows a trend in the opposite direction.
I am struggling to think why this might be the case, although I feel like it might
have something to do with foreign involvement in issues.

\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org6e48c05}
"Both the capacity and willingness of the international community to meaningfully
respond to conflicts has evaporated."

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org814a4fc}
This comes as little surprise to me, as this mirrors the political climate in the
United States quite heavily. This feeling of isolationism is one of the main
factors that got president Trump elected into office in 2016. The international
community seems to be tiring of having to constantly meddle in the affairs of
other countries, and is taking more interest in dealing with domestic issues.
There seems to be some sort of feedback involved - where the longer a conflict
lasts, the more others do not want to get involved, and it lasts longer.

\section{Week 3: Introduction to Globalization}
\label{sec:org614cd9d}
\subsection{Globalization Chapter 1}
\label{sec:orgd39a2ae}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orgf1fe990}
"As he directs his words of contempt for the United States and its allies
at his hand-held microphone, his retreating sleeve exposes a stylish sports
watch\ldots{} The emerging consensus points to a Timex product."

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org82666ad}
Although its probably in bad taste given the situation, I personally find
the irony here to be hilarious. It reminds me heavily of the current situation
in North Korea - the leader there daily shuns and spouts awful things about
and towards the western world, but is also one of the largest consumers of
many of the western world's finest goods. Expensive cars, alcahol, and other
such luxuries that come from his 'enemies'. I also think of the way that the
Islamic State has taken to places like Twitter to recruit new members, but
most of the prominent social media websites being used are all created and
housed within the United States. Without their enemies, their power and
influence would be nowhere near as strong.

\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orga681b8f}
"The ancient Buddhist parable of the blind scholars and their encounter with
the elephant helps to illustrate the nature of the academic controversy over
the various dimensions of globalization"

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org6cd64c8}
The story of the blind scholars and the elephant is one of my favorite ideas
about how a lot of the world works. Many people I believe behave like the 
blind scholars. They possess some part of the truth - even if it is just enough
to be truth. However, they refuse to see any other part of the truth because
it doesn't seem to directly confirm their observations of the world as truth.
These views I believe come out a lot when talking about either politics or
religion, and has been a heavy influencer in creating the current political
climate in the United States.
\subsection{Globalization Chapter 2}
\label{sec:orgb7a51c8}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org15b19e4}
"Over time, food surpluses achieved by these early farmers and herders
led to population increases, the establishment of permanent villages,
and the construction of fortified towns."

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org8d168c8}
When viewing globalization as the spread of ideas on a global scale,
the settling of people during the agricultural revolution actaully
seems like a hinderance in the way of globalization. Before, when
people were hunter gatherers, they covered vast amounts of land. The
likelihood of runing into someone from a different part of the world
was quite high. But after settling, people likely moved very little
from their cities, decreasing the spread of ideas.

\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org95b1973}
"When the accelerating process of industrialization sharpened existing disparities
in wealth and well-being beyond bearable limits, many working people in the global
North began to organize themselves politically in various labour movements and
socialist parties\ldots{} nationalist ideologies captured the imagination of millions
of people around the world."

\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org1fa8613}
Although this is talking about a period around the early 20th century, a lot of
this sounds eerily similar to the current political climate in the world. Many
of the world's elected leaders lean heavy towards nationalist and isolationist
tendencies. Wealth gaps around the world are also increasing rapidly, although
the reason and solution is still hotly debated. There are definitly differences
but the reseblences are a bit unsettling.
\section{Week 4: Economic and Political Globalization}
\label{sec:org9f34545}
\subsection{Globalization Chapter 3}
\label{sec:org4ee627b}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org00e3bf2}
"They resolved to create a more stable money exchange system in which the value
of each country's currency was pegged to a fixed gold value of the US dollar."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org78d32b7}
It has fascinated me how central the US economy is to the world economy. Although
the US dollar is no longer tied to the value of gold, many US economic indicators
still effect the world economies. The value of many investments are tied to the
value of US government bonds. The US dollar is also seen as one of the most stable
currencies in the world.
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org41f084a}
"The most conservative political parties in Europe and the United States rejected
those laissez-faire ideas and instead embraced a rather extensive version of state
intervention propagated by British economist John Maynard Keynes."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orga629205}
This philosophy of economic governing is still very prevelant in the world. Keyne's
polocies and ideas were part of the backing for the bailouts of the '08 housing
bubble. Other countries around the world apply a very hands on approach to their
countries economies, and very few places in the world really have a free market
economy in line with Hayak economic ideals.
\subsection{Globalization Chapter 4}
\label{sec:org23eacb9}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org4f91c05}
"Wilson's commitment to the nation-state coexisted with his internationalist dream
of establishing a global system of collective security under the auspices of a new
international organization, the League of Nations. His idea\ldots{} was eventually
realized with the founding of the United Nations in 1945."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orgf398d4a}
The UN is a prime example and one of the largest drivers of globalization in the
modern era. The idea of a globalization forming a large world paradigm aligns
perfectly with the organization of a global governmental body, exerting very
limited order over the countries of the world. However, the UN isn't very
effective as the US walks all over many of the decisions it makes. This is shown
recently by Trumps decision on Jerusalem in the Middle East.
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org3600279}
"Economic forms of interdependence are set into motion by political decisions,
but these decisions are nonetheless made in particular economic contexts."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org0918260}
I believe this observation leads to a lot of terrible decisions by governments.
Many economic policies and decisions are created as a spur of the moment decision.
Although many of these seem great at the time, they tend to pile up over time into
a huge spaggheti mess of laws and regulations that make economic endevers so
difficult that it slows economic activity.
\section{Week 5: Global Cities}
\label{sec:org8f4cc8f}
\subsection{The Global City: Introducing a Concept}
\label{sec:orgac82185}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orgdc0f925}
"First, the geographic dispersal of economic activities that marks globalization,
along with the simultaneious integration of such geopraphically dispersed activities,
is a key factor feeding the growth and importance of central corporate functions."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org4a7be5f}
I find it interesting that the first thing that is said to mark a global city is
an economic indicator, and not a cultural one. Typically when I think of globalization
I think of cultural spreading of ideas.
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org13bcf46}
"The geography of globalization contains both a dynamic of dispersal and of
centralization. The massive trend towards the spatial dispersal of economic activities
at the metropolitan, national, and global level which we associate with globalization
have contributed to a demand for new forms of territorial centralization."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orgac13870}
Globalization would not exist without global cities. Although the world is very much
connected, it is not connected evenly. Most of these connections occur through these
global cities, as this is where the centralization of these businesses occur. The
dispersal of activities is because of the centralization of their headquarters in
these cities.
\subsection{Redefining Global Cities: The Seven Types of Global Metro Economics}
\label{sec:orgd153365}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org262daab}
"This process is not preordained. Africa's urbanization, for instance, has not been
accompanied by widespread industrialization."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org7798a59}
This to me is very puzzling, and distrurbing. To me, industrialization is what makes
cities successful, and provides the foundation of the urban economy. I believe lots
of this is due to the governing of those areas, and their innefective policies.
Industrialization naturally seems to come with urbanization, and when it doesn't
something else is most likely the issue.
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org821ae84}
"China's insertion into the global trade system resulted in significant job losses in
US labor markets that specialize in manufacturing. In the developing world, there is
an argument to be made that the globalization of labor, trade, and capital markets,
along with bringing new knowledge and technologies, has contributed to economic
instability and rising inequities within nations"
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org229e5d3}
Many political arguments are based around this fact, and many people in the US blame
the US trading with China for the instability and wealth inequality in the Country.
However, rarely discussed is the benefits that this trade brings. Prices across the
board are lower whenever markets are expanded, effective income and purchasing power
are increased, and quality of life as a whole rises due to markets becoming larger.
\section{Week 6}
\label{sec:orge0ed6b2}
\subsection{Redefining Global Cities: The Seven Types of Global Metro Economics}
\label{sec:org89779dd}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orgd46c54d}
"A little under one in size residents of a Global Giant is foreign born."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orgb0b4860}
This is what to me truly makes any city a global city. Although much of it is for
economic reasons, it is the cultural diversity of people from all places of the globe
that truly make a city global. This is in stark comparison to the smaller places
that I have lived before, where almost half the people are from the same state, and
almost all from the same country.
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org0b527ca}
"National governments also bear some responsibility for supporting cities that have
experienced industrial decline as a result of global competition."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org5e4496b}
This is a very opinionated statement that is definitly shared by all people. This
is a liberal stance, stating that it is the job of the government, and therefore
taxpayers, to help people who are in outdated or outsourced jobs. I know many
more libertarian minded people who would disagree with this being a role of
the national government.
\section{Week 7}
\label{sec:orgaec2c9a}
\subsection{Inspiring Future Cities (Pg 6 -- 37)}
\label{sec:org6b580cf}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orgb5c846c}
"Global citizens are seeking enhanced interaction and multi-layered experiences,
with technology the key enabler of cultural exchange and engagement. Citizens\ldots{}
are particularly attuned to sustainability issues, expecting goods and services
to be produced and delivered responsibly."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org99254d3}
I find fault with this. Although there are people in the world who do care about
these things in their lives, I would say the majority of people living in the city
have very little mind about these things, especially in developing countries.
Many people tend to not worry about such things until their own financial situation
is at a comfortable level, which has not happened for a lot of the world's population.
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org7ed9bbe}
"Rudimentary Technology and Business Models: Limited adoption of technology and few
public-private partnerships"
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org5b0e749}
Why are public entities seen as such a necessity to future cities? Private industry
and the free market provide the real power behind cities being the giants they are,
not the governments that watch over them.
\section{Week 8: Cultural Challenges of Globalization}
\label{sec:org191cfcb}
\subsection{Globalization Chapter 5}
\label{sec:orgb0575db}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orgfc201ce}
"Does globalization make people around the world more alike or more different?"
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org9dda909}
I firmly believe more alike. As people learn more about people around the world,
they pick up different things about them, and as more and more people go through
this process they become like eachother, absorbing small parts of their culture.
However, I don't think it will ever come to completion though, as people will
always hold onto what makes them individuals.
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org646fe57}
"During the last two decades, a small group of very large TNCs have come to
dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film.
In 2000 only 10 media conglomerates\ldots{} acounted for more than two-thirds
of the 250 billion in annual worldwide revenues generated by the communications
industry."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org9d03a78}
Although this is all about globalization, it is very important to mention
that almost all of these companies are American founded and based corporations.
Globalization happens to all, but by no means does it happen equally.
\subsection{Globalization Chapter 6}
\label{sec:orge2928ef}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org5543276}
"Claim 2: Globalization is inevitable and irreversible"
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org2f71d03}
I have very strange feelings about this claim, mostly based upon the definitions
of inevitable. If inevitable is taken to mean it is physically impossible for
globalization to ever be reversed, then I would claim that is false. It is
entirely possible for nations to almost completely shut out the outside world,
with N Korea as a prime example. However, with viewing inevitable as an almost
certainty that things will happen, this would be a more accurate claim. Yes,
parts of the world could shut itself out, but because there is almost no
incentive for a nation to do such a thing it will likely never happen on
a global scale.
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org0109f8d}
"The low US unemployment rate in the 1990s, often cited by globalists as
evidence for the economic benefits of globalization\ldots{}"
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orgcdde819}
This is a horrible time to look at to analyze the effects of globalization.
Although it is true that there was low unemployment and lots of economic
activity during this era, much of this was due to an economic bubble that
was occuring during that time, and had little to do with globalization.
Bubbles and recessions have happened both since and before, so pointing
to this time peroid as an indicator of globalizations power is just silly.
\subsection{The Clash of Civilizations Twenty Years On (Pg 6 -- 27)}
\label{sec:org0e1f1fa}
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:org73532a8}
"By 1991, the Soviet Union and its system as well as its parasitic coterie
of attendant nations was no more. This left a gulf, a hole, a vacuum. How,
and with what, to fill it?"
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:org49678b1}
Power vacuums have been one of the reasons that many areas of the world
that have unstable pasts and history remain unstable today. As an entity
crumbles, a void is left. This is then filled by usually another entity,
but due to the rapid change of hands this new entity is just as unstable
as the last. It is a vicious cycle that is difficult to disrupt.
\subsubsection{Quote}
\label{sec:orgcb4a0c2}
"Time has shown, once again, that anyone who takes seriously the idea of
a world divided into seven or eight majore civilizations lack the capacity
to have any possible understanding of our fascinating mosaic of a world
filled with myriad ideas, norms, beliefs, and conceptions about how the
world is."
\subsubsection{Response}
\label{sec:orgbd8dc80}
Although this is an opinionated statement, I do agree with much it is
saying. The world being divided like this, and only focussing on contension
between these groups makes very little sense to me. For example, if all
violence and struggle between the United States and other "civilizations"
was removed from the world, would it be a suddenly peaceful and prosperous
place? Far from, as internal struggles within all of these civilizations
is often more prevelant, as it is closer to home to those who live there.
