\section{10 Water Laws of The West}
\label{sec-1}
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-1-1}
"The Third Water Law of the West, also invented by Los Angeles, is that 'if you don't have the
water, you won't need it.' This is sometimes stated as 'he who brings the water brings the
people'."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-1-2}
In the long term this is very true, but in the short term flucuations of water this can be misleading.
Whenever California is experiencing issues with drought a lot of farmers suffere greatly, so the
idea that you don't need water you don't have does not quite apply here. However, if California were
to have less water for a very long time, the people would adapt and farmers would either find
another profession or switch to growing less water intensive crops like they currently do.
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-1-3}
"The Fourth Water Law of the West, embodied in the West's surface water laws, is the doctrine
of 'prior appropriation' translated into 'first in time is first in right'."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-1-4}
In my personal opinion, this is really dumb. First come first serve to natural resources is a very
unequitable system, not just in equality of wealth but in equality of opportunity. Water is a
quite valuable resource, but some people have to waste the water they have just to state that it
was "used" so they do not lose rights to the water. It is a huge cost to society, with little gain.

\section{Canadian Teen Tells UN to 'Warrior Up,' Give Water Same Protections as People}
\label{sec-2}
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-2-1}
"'No one should have to worry if the water is clean or if they will run out of water,' Peltier
said in her speech. 'No child should grow up not knowing what clean water is or never know what
running water is. We all have a right to this water as we need it --- not just rich people, all
people.'"
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-2-2}
This reminds me of one of the slides in lecture that referenced the huge water usage of golf
courses in the united states. Golf is typically a sport played by rich white males, who
by extension use excessive amounts of water for a past time, while some people can't have
running water in their house. This just highlights the issues with our current system of
water management, and the failures of the first come first serve system.
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-2-3}
"If you want to become a water keeper: Learn as much as you can from your elders and your teachers"
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-2-4}
I would take this piece of advice with a grain of salt. Although there is lots that we can learn
from our elders, lots of it is not good. People in the past have been just as wasteful if not
more wasteful with natural resources than we are, and looking to them for advice can keep us
from looking forward for new ideas. It is our elders and people of the past that put us in
many of the messes we are in today, so they may not be the best place to seek advice.

\section{Environmental Changes and Violent Conflict}
\label{sec-3}
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-3-1}
"Homer-Dixon for instance argues that decreasing access to renewable resources increases
frustration, which in turn creates grievances against the state, weakens the state and civil
society and increases to opportunity for investigating an insurrection."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-3-2}
I would modify this slightly. Although it is reasonable, just decreasing access to renewable
resources does not account for non renewable resources that take its place. Most people do
not have a preference for where their stuff comes from, as long as it is cheap and does
what they need. However, if both renewable and non-renewable resources have decreased access
then violence and conflict will likely increase.
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-3-3}
"The evidence from quantitative large-N studies strongly suggests, however, that we should be
very careful in drawing general conclusions from location and time-specific case study results\ldots
Overall, the existing evidence suggests that environmental changes may, under specific
circumstances, increase the risk of violent conflict --- but do not systematically do so."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-3-4}
This is such a vague conclusion. This is the difficulty with trying to measure something as complex
as violent conflict in relation to something as complex as environmental issues. Conflict in a
region can be caused by so many issues that isolating the causes are almost impossible.
There are also so many different types of environmental changes, that treating them all the same
in this context is unwise. Drought, flood, and increased temperatures will all likely have different
effects on a group of people.

\section{Religion Can Make Us More Environmentally Friendly --- or Not}
\label{sec-4}
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-4-1}
"ARC members\ldots showed the sheikhs passages in the Koran that promote pro-environmental
behavior, and told them that dynamite fishing goes against these teachings. The sheikhs spread
the information to their community and, as devout Muslims, the fisherman listened."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-4-2}
Although this seems like a huge victory, the question I have is whether this would have been
so difficult if the people were not religious in the first place. Many things were tried
before the religious approach to stop the fishing, and it is possible that if the fisherman
were not as rooted in their religion they would have listened to the legal and environmental
reasons to not fish with dynamite.
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-4-3}
"A 2013 study in Indonesia showed that incorporating conservation messages into Islamic sermons
increased both public awareness and levels of concern. 'Since then, Indonesia issued its first
fatwas prohibiting illegal wildlife trafficking and poaching'"
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-4-4}
Religion is such a difficult topic to discuss, as almost all religions are dependent upon
interpretation of the religion. As this shows, a different interpretation of a religious text
was able to change political laws and affect an entire country in a real way. From what I have
seen, the differences between religious people have a lot more to do with what they choose to
interpret the religion and its ideals and less to do with what the actual religion is.

\section{World Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice}
\label{sec-5}
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-5-1}
"Sustainability transitions come about in diverse ways, and all require civil-society pressure
and evidence-based advocacy, political leadership, and a solid understanding of policy instruments,
markets, and other drivers."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-5-2}
This is one of the difficulties of creating environmental change. It requires change from so many
areas, that a lack of change in one area will make it not viable. If the technology is there, and
the cost of change it cheap, but political forces will keep it from being adopted the change will
never happen. One example of this is the desalination plants in some areas of the middle east.
Desalitation had become cheap, but the dictators of the region did not want to lose control over
the limited water supply.
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-5-3}
"With the exception of stabilizing the stratospheric ozone layer, humanity has failed to make
sufficient progress in generally solving these foreseen environmental challenges, and alarmingly,
most of them are getting far worse.
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-5-4}
The ozone stabilization is one of the greatest achievements of the past few decades. It is an
example of how to create lasting environmental change in the world. Although each issue has
its own intricacies and specifics, there are lessons to be learned. One of the advantages it
had was that it never went political in a way like water or climate change has. When climate
change went political by Al Gore, it hurt the possibility of change within congress or otherwise.

\section{The Water-Food-Energy Nexus --- Realising a New Paradigm}
\label{sec-6}
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-6-1}
"The Climate Risk Index ranks countries based on annually occuring human and economic losses
due to climate events (floods, draughts, other extreme events). The index is used as an indicator
that better reflects the current status of the climate change dimension"
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-6-2}
Splitting climate change issues into countries is a very strange way to view climate change. Many
environmental issues have large scale regional or even global causes and effects that encompass
many countries. The only environmental aspect that could be related to a country instead of
another geographic region is related to policy. Environmental effects in a country can vary
from its neighbors due to how a government chooses to handle a situation.
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-6-3}
"The improved understanding of sectoral linkages and Nexus-wide dynamics reveals a set of elements
that are important in 'transmitting' ripple effects throughout the Nexus system. The Mekong
investigations revealed that what is typically conceptualised as a simple arrow is more accurately
described as a series of interlinked variables."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-6-4}
Like many things in this world, interconnections between different ideas are stronger than might
first be believed. Although this can complicate the isolated study of these elements, it can
increase understanding of why things happen when and how they do.

\section{Conserving a Used Planet: Embracing Our History as Transformers of Earth}
\label{sec-7}
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-7-1}
"By as early as 5,000 years ago, for instance, ecosystems across more than 20\% of Europe
and Asia had already been transformed --- i.e., had their biodiversity and ecosystem processes
significantly altered --- by intensive human use of land."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-7-2}
Domestication of plants and animals is one of the earliest examples of this happening. Although
less natural GMOs are a recent development, changing of DNA through breeding has been practiced
for thousands of years. This allowed the intensive use of the earth's land that is being talked
about.
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-7-3}
"The idea that advanced technologies are inherently harmful must be replaced by the reality that
these technologies have always been the means by which our species has survived and prospered.
This is not to say that all technologies are good or that technological dependence is without
issue. A host of problems emerges from almost every technology we use."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-7-4}
Advanced technologies are only harmful if they are not developed and used responsibly. Technology
by itself is not good or bad, it just is. It is the use of technology that can be helpful or
harmful to society. Oil drilling equipment can be used for something bad, but many of the
technologies that are used to create drilling equipment can likely be also used to manufacture
nuclear power equipment or solar power equipment, which can be used for good.

\section{The Rousseauean Moment}
\label{sec-8}
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-8-1}
"By its very nature, parasitism is exploitave --- a one-way, one-sided process that tends
to leave the host debilitated, if not dead. Yet it is precisely this exploitation of the
rural and natural periphery that permits those who inhabit the urban core to live high on
the ecological hog."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-8-2}
This is a very one sided way to view the relation between rural and urban areas. Yes urban
areas do depend upon the surrounding rural areas, but rural areas also depend on cities to
consume the goods that they produce. Farmers need people to buy their crops, and if a large
city is nearby then they can be quite profitable due to proximity.
\subsection{Quote}
\label{sec-8-3}
"Thus although technology will be an indispensable part of the solution, it must be an enhanced,
ecological technology that makes it possible for humanity to live once again by usufruct instead
of exploitation."
\subsection{Response}
\label{sec-8-4}
Technology alone cannot solve environmental issues, but paired with political and societal change
technology can be a powerful tool in solving environmental issues that have been created by
people. Although there exists many alternatives to fossil fuels, there are political and economic
issues that prevent them from becoming widespread in todays world.
