#+TITLE: Operating Systems Study Guide
#+AUTHOR: Ross Lannen

* Computer Systems Overview
  - System Call :: Request to the operating system to perform some action outside of the program execution space
  - Data Registers :: Registers in the CPU that hold the data currently being operated on
  - Address Registers :: Registers in the CPU that hold memory locations to load into the data registers
  - PC :: Register that holds the address of the currently executing instruction
  - Instruction Register :: Register that holds the current instruction being executed
  - PSW :: Some other register?
  - Interrupt :: Signal sent to the CPU telling it to execute something else
  - Interrupt Flag :: Flag that signals an interrupt has been sent
  - Hit Ratio :: Percentage of the time a piece of data is found at a specific level of memory
  - Temporal Locality :: The access of the same data in memory multiple times in a certain amount of time
  - Spatial Locality :: The access of data in memory that is close together spatially in memory
  - Cache :: Small fast memory that is used to store items often accessed by a process
  - Memory/Storage Hierarchy :: Tiered memory system where fast small memory is close to the CPU, and large slow storage is far away
        
* Operating Systems Overview
  - OS :: Program that provides an interface between the user and the hardware
  - Kernel :: Core functionality of the OS, first piece that is loaded upon booting
  - Turnaround Time :: Time it takes to complete a job
  - Multiprogramming :: The ability to hold multiple proesses in memory and switch between them
  - Time Slice :: Amount of time given to a program to execute on a CPU before being preempted
  - Process Switch :: Task of changing the currently executed proccess on a CPU
  - Process :: A set of instructions and the data associated with it to complete a task
  - Base Register :: Starting address of a region of memory occupied by a process
  - Limit Register :: Ending address of a region of memory occupied by a process
  - Thread :: A set of instructions belonging to a process. Can be multiple threads that execute cooperatively
  - Multi-Threaded Process :: Process that contains multiple threads of execution
  - DOM :: Degree of multiprogramming. Is the maximum number of processes that a single process system can accommodate efficiently
           
* Process Description and Control
  - Swapping :: The steps of taking one process off of the CPU, and putting another on
  - Ready Queue :: Queue of processes that are in memory and ready to be executed
  - Event Queues :: Queue of processes waiting on an event to occur before they can become unblocked and changed to ready
  - Preemption :: A process bumping another running process off of the CPU due to a time slice expiring
  - Process Switch :: Task of changing the currently executing process
  - Fork :: Creates a duplicate of a running process with a different PID
  - Exec :: Executes a program, completely replacing the old process space with the new
  - Wait :: Waits for a child process to terminate before continuing execution
  - Pipe :: File descriptors that can be written and read by 2 different processes to communicate

* Threads
  - ULT :: User Level Thread. 
  - KLT :: Kernel Level Thread. 
           
* CPU Scheduling
  - Throughput :: 
  - CPU Utilization ::
  - CPU Efficiency ::
  - Average Turnaround Time :: 
  - Normalized Turnaround Time ::
  - Response Time ::
  - Waiting Time ::
  - Gantt Chart ::
  - Starvation ::
  - Aging ::
  - Time Slice ::
