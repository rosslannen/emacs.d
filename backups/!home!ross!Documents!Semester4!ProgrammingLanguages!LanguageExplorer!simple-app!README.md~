# simple-app

A simple twitter/blog-like SPA, and local backend server. Currently
the SPA is not completely hooked up to the backend routes, and the
create new post forms do not actually yet create new forms. Both the
javascript SPA front end, and the server backend running on the JVM
were written in Clojure, making for 2 seperate program components for
the Language Explore Project.

## Usage

From the project root run:

    $ java -jar target/uberjar/simple-app-0.1.0-standalone.jar
    
Then navigate to localhost:3000/
